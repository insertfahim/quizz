# Repository Cleanup Instructions

## Issues Identified

1. The `.next` directory is being tracked in your git repository. This directory contains build artifacts and should not be committed.
2. While `package-lock.json` is not currently tracked, it's good to decide whether you want to track it or not based on your team's preferences.

## Cleanup Steps

### 1. Update .gitignore

I've created an updated `.gitignore` file at `.gitignore-updated`. Review it and replace your current `.gitignore`:

```bash
# Review the differences
diff .gitignore .gitignore-updated

# If satisfied, replace the old one
mv .gitignore-updated .gitignore
```

### 2. Remove .next from Git Tracking

To remove the `.next` directory from git tracking (but keep it on your local filesystem):

```bash
git rm -r --cached .next
git commit -m "Remove .next directory from git tracking"
```

### 3. Verify Cleanup

After making these changes, verify that the repository is clean:

```bash
git status
```

## Best Practices for Repository Management

1. **Don't commit build artifacts**: Files like those in `.next`, `dist`, or `build` directories should be generated during build processes, not stored in git.

2. **Lock files**:

    - For team projects, commit `package-lock.json` to ensure all developers use the same dependency versions.
    - For personal projects, you may choose to ignore it.

3. **Large files**: Use Git LFS (Large File Storage) for any large binary files that need to be tracked.

4. **Environment variables**: Never commit `.env` files with sensitive information. Use `.env.example` files to show the structure without real values.

5. **Regular cleanup**: Periodically run `git gc` to clean up and optimize your repository.

6. **Dependency management**:

    - Always use `npm install` to install dependencies locally.
    - Never commit the `node_modules` directory.

7. **Branch management**: Regularly delete merged and stale branches to keep your repository clean.
